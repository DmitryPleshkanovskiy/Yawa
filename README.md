# Yet Another Weather App

This is a simple weather app made using the tomorrow.io API. It consists of three main screens - the forecast screen, the current weather map and the settings screen.

It's called YAWA which stands for "Yet Another Weather App'.

Demo stage server: [dev.yawa.dpserver.org](https://dev.yawa.dpserver.org/)

To run the application locally you need to fill in the ```.env``` file with the api address and access key values. See ```.env.example``` file.

The forecast screen displays the current weather, a detailed 24-hour forecast, and a general 7-day forecast.

The weather map displays two layers - a layer of cloudiness and precipitation intensity.

On the settings screen, you can set your location for which the forecast and map will be displayed.

Demonstrated working with basic react concepts (such as reusable components, react hooks, context api, HOC, lazy loading etc.), working with the weather api, browser api and third-party libraries. The design is based on the bootstrap library, SCSS modules are used. The map is implemented using the leaflet opensource library.

Auto-deploy is also implemented using the СI/СD pipelines of the gitlab.com platform.

The app is still a bit raw. In some places you can find TODO comments describing possible improvements and new features.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
